    <h2>What Are the Forces of Evolution?</h2>
    <p>Evolution is driven by four key forces that change the genetic makeup of populations over time. Let’s break them down simply and clearly so they stick in your mind.</p>

    <div class="force">
      <h3>1. Natural Selection</h3>
      <p>Think of it as nature's talent show. Traits that help organisms survive and reproduce get passed on more often. Over time, these helpful traits become more common in the population.</p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> In a snowy environment, white fur helps animals hide. Those with white fur survive better and have more offspring.
    </div>

    <div class="force">
      <h3>2. Mutation</h3>
      <p>Mutations are random changes in DNA, like typos in a genetic instruction manual. Most are neutral, some are harmful, and a few can be beneficial. They're the source of all genetic variation.</p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A mutation might give a bird a slightly longer beak, which helps it get more food.
    </div>

    <div class="force">
      <h3>3. Gene Flow</h3>
      <p>Gene flow is the movement of genes between populations. When individuals from different groups mate, they introduce new genes to the population.</p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A bird from island A flies to island B and mates. The offspring carry genes from both islands.
    </div>

    <div class="force">
      <h3>4. Genetic Drift</h3>
      <p>Genetic drift is random change in gene frequencies, especially in small populations. Unlike natural selection, it’s not about survival—just luck.</p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> If a storm randomly wipes out half a population, the genetic makeup of the survivors may be very different.
    </div>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding these forces helps us trace how species—including humans—have changed over millions of years. It’s key to everything in evolutionary biology.</p>
